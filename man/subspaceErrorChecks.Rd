subspaceErrorChecks(
  X,
  subspaceDim,
  threshold,
  numCpts,
  thresholdValue,
  msl,
  nperm,
  Class
)
}
\arguments{
\item{X}{Data matrix of dimension n by p}

\item{subspaceDim}{Dimension of the latent subspace}

\item{threshold}{Threshold choice for determining significance of changepoints. Choices include:
\itemize{
\item "PermTest" - Permutation test is performed using the number of permutations and significance level contained in the nperm and thresholdValue parameters respectively
\item "Manual" - A user chosen threshold is used which is contained in the thresholdValue argument.
}
If numCpts is numeric then the threshold is not used as the number of changepoints is known.}

\item{numCpts}{Number of changepoints in the data. Choices include:
\itemize{
\item "AMOC" - At Most One Changepoint; test to see if the data contains a single changepoint or not.
\item "BinSeg"- Binary segmentation is performed to detect multiple changepoints.
\item Numeric - User specified number of changepoints.
}}

\item{thresholdValue}{Either the significance level of the permutation test when using threshold="PermTest" or the user defined threshold when using threshold="Manual".}

\item{msl}{Minimum segment length allowed between the changepoints. NOTE this should be greater than or equal to p, the dimension of the time series.}

\item{nperm}{Only required for threshold="PermTest". Number of permutations to use in the permutation test.}

\item{Class}{Logical. If TRUE then an S4 class is returned. Else just the estimated changepoints are returned.}
